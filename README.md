# Material Resume Blue
Clone of material resume design [here](https://creativemarket.com/ikonome/686585-Material-Resume-Blue/screenshots#screenshot2) in modern HTML/CSS. I made this as practice, to brush up my frontend skills. There is no Javascript used in this, though thinking of adding animations.
