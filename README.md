# Material Resume Blue
Clone of material resume design [here](https://creativemarket.com/ikonome/686585-Material-Resume-Blue/screenshots#screenshot2) in modern HTML/CSS. I made this as practice, to brush up frontend skills.

## Features used 
* SVG progress circles
* Flexbox 
* Skill bar in pure CSS
* Bulletpoint list 

## To do
* Make it responsive - look ugly in low resolutions.
* Refactor!
